    <p>It was England’s first knockout round victory inside 90 minutes at the Euros and came after midfielder Jack
        Grealish was introduced in the 69th minute.</p>
    <p>Six minutes later, after a swift passing move, left wing-back Luke Shaw slipped the ball across the face of the
        goal for Sterling to slide in – sparking excitement among 45,000 fans at Wembley with “Football’s Coming Home”
        echoing around the iconic arena after the final whistle.</p>

    <p>Grealish was the direct provider for England’s second, crossing from the left for Kane to beat goalkeeper Manuel
        Neuer with a stooping header.</p>
    <p>Earlier, England keeper Jordan Pickford did well to keep out Timo Werner before tipping over a stinging volley
        from Kai Havertz. At the other end, Mats Hummels denied Kane with a last-ditch clearance just before halftime.

        <p>“We knew we needed a big performance against a difficult side, and we did that today,” Sterling said. “Doing
            it for your country is always special.”</p>
        <p>“We knew the intensity we could play at, not a lot of teams can deal with it … All-round, great team
            performance.”</p>
        <p>“We take it game by game, we go away, recover and get focused onto the next one.”</p>
